# BlindEye

The aim of this project is to develop an activity recognition algorithm with different applications ranging from elderly care, anomaly and alarm detection to architectural robotics or learning gamification.

In this repository we include the code that start by estimating the users position and detecting the objects and their interactions. The codes are based on the forked repo (https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation) and the YOLO python implementation from https://github.com/madhawav/YOLO3-4-Py
